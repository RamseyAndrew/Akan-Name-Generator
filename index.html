    <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
    <p>The Akan Name Generator is a web application designed to determine and display
       a user’s Akan name based on the day of the week they were born and their gender. 
       Akan names are traditional Ghanaian names assigned  to the day of birth 
       and differ for males and females. The application collects the user’s date of birth
        (day, month, and year) and gender through a form. Using a mathematical formula, the app
         calculates the exact day of the week the user was born. Based on the result and 
         the selected gender, the app maps the day to a corresponding Akan name from 
         predefined arrays of male and female names. The chosen Akan name, along with the
          day of the week, is then dynamically displayed to the user in a user-friendly 
          message. This project not only offers a cultural insight into Akan traditions
           but also provides a fun, interactive way for users to learn about the 
           significance of their birth day in a different cultural context.</p>
